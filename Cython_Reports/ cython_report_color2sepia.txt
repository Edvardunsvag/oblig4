1.
Average runtime running cython_color2sepia after 3 runs : 
    - First run: 4 function calls in 7.497 seconds
    - Second run: 4 function calls in 6.980 seconds
    - Third run: 4 function calls in 8.108 seconds

    Average: 7.52 seconds


2. 
Average runtime for running cython_color2sepia is 1.18 times
faster than python color2gray .py.
    - Python_color2sepia - Average = 8.844 seconds.
    - Cython color2sepia Average : 7.52 seconds
    - 8.844  / 7.52 = 1.18 times


3.
Average runtime for running cython_color2sepia is 227 times
slower than numpy color2gray.py
    - Numpy color2sepia Average :  0.033 seconds
    - Cython color2sepia Average : 7.52 seconds
    - 7.52 / 0.033 = 227 times



4.
Average runtime for running cython color2gray is 1.12 times
slower than numba color2gray.py
    - numba_color2sepia - Average = 8.45 seconds
    - Cython color2sepia Average : 7.52 seconds
    - 8.45  / 7.52  = 1.12

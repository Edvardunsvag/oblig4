    -First run: 4 function calls in 0.493 seconds
    -Second run: 4 function calls in 0.508 seconds
    -Third run: 4 function calls in 0.502 seconds
    - Average after 3 runs: 0.501 seconds


2. 
Average runtime for running cython color2gray is 4.43 times
faster than python color2gray .py.
    - Python color2gray Average : 2.223 seconds
    - Cython color2gray Average : 0.501 seconds
    - 2.223 / 0.501 = 4.43


3.
Average runtime for running cython color2gray is 26.3 times
slower than numpy color2gray.py
    - Numpy color2gray Average : 0.019 seconds
    - Cython color2gray Average : 0.501 seconds
    - 0.501 / 0.019 = 26.3 times



4.

We expect you also to prepare a report containing the dimensions of the image being grayscaled (that is, H,W,C):
    h = 400
    w = 600
    c = 3

Timing : 
    numpy_color2gray

3.
Average runtime running numpy color2gray after 3 runs : 
    - First run: 13 function calls in 0.023 seconds
    - Second run: 13 function calls in 0.017 seconds
    - Third run: 13 function calls in 0.018 seconds

    Average: 0.019 seconds

4.
Average runtime running of numpy color2gray is 116 times faster
than python color2gray:

    python_color2gray - Average = 2.22
    numpy_color2gray - Average = 0.019
    numpy_color2gray is 116 times faster on Average

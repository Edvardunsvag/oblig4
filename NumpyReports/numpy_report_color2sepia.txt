We expect you also to prepare a report containing the dimensions of the image being grayscaled (that is, H,W,C):
    h = 400
    w = 600
    c = 3

Average runtime running numpy_color2sepia after 3 runs : 
    - First run: 720039 function calls in 0.311 seconds
    - Second run: 720039 function calls in 0.345 seconds
    - Third run: 720039 function calls in 0.335 seconds

    Average: 0.033 seconds

4.
Average runtime running of numpy_color2sepia is 268 times faster
than python color2sepia:

    python_color2sepia - Average = 8.844 seconds.
    numpy_color2sepia - Average = 0.33 seconds
    numpy_color2sepia is 26,7 times faster on Average

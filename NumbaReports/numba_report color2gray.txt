Can you think of any advantages/disadvantages to using Numba instead of NumPy? Name them in your report.
    Numba has to compile the function before it executes the machine code version
    of the function, and this takes time. However, ones the compilation is finished, 
    numba caches the machine code version of the function. If it is called again, with 
    the same types, it can be reused, instead of being compiled again.

    In our case it was a disadvantage to use numba because of the time of the first compiling.
    The second and third run of numba was a lot faster than what numpy managed, but the first was to big of a factor.

Average runtime running numpy color2gray after 3 runs :
    - Average: 0.019 seconds


3.
Average runtime for running numba color2gray is 8.9 times
faster than python color2gray .py.
    - python_color2gray - Average = 2.223 seconds
    - numba_color2gray - Average = 0.248 seconds
    Numba is 8.9 times faster than python
    

4.
Average runtime for running numba color2gray is:
    - Elapsed (with compilation) = 0.6600019931793213
    - Elapsed (after compilation-1) = 0.007760047912597656
    - Elapsed (after compilation-2) = 0.007128715515136719

    numba_color2Gray - Average = 0.224 seconds
    nymPy_color2Gray - Average = 0.019

    Nuba is 11.7 times
    slower than numpy_color2gray.py
